## The Concept

In many cultures, lighting a lamp or diya is a symbol of hope, positivity, and togetherness. This app brings that tradition to the digital world. A user can create a unique "Celebration" page and share a link with their friends and family. Everyone who visits the link can light a diya, and the display updates instantly for all participants, showing who lit each light.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Collaboration:** Diyas light up instantly for all users on the page without needing a refresh, powered by Supabase Realtime Subscriptions.
*   **Shareable Celebration Links:** Generate a unique link for your private group to share with anyone.
*   **Flexible Participation:** Users can join with their Google account to display their name, or participate instantly as an anonymous guest with a custom display name.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI:** A beautiful, mobile-first design built with Tailwind CSS that provides a seamless experience on any device.
